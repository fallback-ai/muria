# Export YOLO Models to LiteRT for Edge and Web Deployment[#](#export-yolo-models-to-litert-for-edge-and-web-deployment)

![LiteRT edge deployment framework](https://cdn.ul.run/i/77f69836dfc1d1e96a7e9c9968fa98fd.avif)

[LiteRT](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/overview) (short for *Lite Runtime*) is Google's high-performance runtime for on-device AI. It is the next generation and the new name for TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), and it runs the same `.tflite` model format. With LiteRT, a single exported [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) model deploys across **mobile, embedded, edge, and the browser** — covering everything that the older `tflite` and `tfjs` export formats handled separately, now under one umbrella.

**Watch:** How to Export Ultralytics YOLO26 to Google LiteRT | Deploy Vision AI on Android & iOS | Mobile AI 📱🚀

The LiteRT export format optimizes your models for tasks like [object detection](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-detection), [segmentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-segmentation), [pose estimation](/tasks/pose), and [classification](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/image-classification) so they run fast and offline on a wide range of devices.

Run YOLO on Android with LiteRT today via the official Flutter plugin

The official [Ultralytics YOLO Flutter plugin](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolo-flutter-app) runs LiteRT `.tflite` exports on Android out of the box — real-time camera inference, single-image prediction, GPU acceleration, and automatic model download for all seven YOLO26 tasks, including Depth. For Apple devices use the [CoreML export](/integrations/coreml); for Qualcomm Snapdragon NPUs see the [Qualcomm QNN integration](/integrations/qnn).

Official mobile input sizes

Export classification models at `imgsz=224`. Export detect, segment, semantic, depth, pose, and OBB models at
`imgsz=640`. This 224/640 standard is shared by the official LiteRT, CoreML, and QNN mobile assets.

Run YOLO on Web with LiteRT.js today via the official @ultralytics/yolo npm package

The official [Ultralytics YOLO NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ultralytics/yolo) runs LiteRT `.tflite` exports directly in the browser via [LiteRT.js](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/web) no server or Python required — with real-time webcam inference, single-image prediction, and WebGPU acceleration (automatic CPU/WASM fallback) across six YOLO26 tasks (detect, segment, semantic, classify, pose, OBB). On WebGPU it's often ~2× faster than ONNX Runtime Web.

```auto
npm i @ultralytics/yolo @litertjs/core
```

## Why Should You Export to LiteRT?[#](#why-should-you-export-to-litert)

[LiteRT](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/overview) is an open-source framework designed for on-device inference, also known as [edge computing](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/edge-computing). It gives developers the tools to execute trained models on mobile, embedded, and IoT devices, traditional computers, and — through [LiteRT.js](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/web) — directly in web browsers and Node.js.

One model format, every target:

- **Mobile & Embedded**: Android, iOS, embedded Linux, and microcontrollers (MCUs).
- **Edge accelerators**: Compatible with the [Coral Edge TPU](/integrations/edge-tpu) for further acceleration.
- **Browser & Node.js**: [LiteRT.js](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/web) runs the same `.tflite` model on the web with WebGPU/WASM acceleration — replacing the need for a separate TensorFlow.js export.

## Key Features of LiteRT Models[#](#key-features-of-litert-models)

- **On-device Optimization**: Reduces latency by processing data locally, enhances privacy by not transmitting personal data, and minimizes model size to save space.
- **Multiple Platform Support**: Runs on Android, iOS, embedded Linux, microcontrollers, and modern web browsers.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Leverages XNNPACK on CPU, and GPU acceleration via OpenCL, Metal, and WebGPU. The GPU delegate runs in FP16 by default for additional speed.
- **Quantization**: Supports FP32, static INT8 (`quantize=8`, int8 weights + int8 activations), static INT16-activation (`quantize="w8a16"`, int8 weights + int16 activations for higher accuracy), and dynamic INT8 (`quantize="w8a32"`, int8 weights + FP32 activations, no calibration data needed) to compress models and speed up inference with minimal [accuracy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/accuracy) loss.
- **Diverse Language Support**: Compatible with Java/Kotlin, Swift, Objective-C, C++, Python, and JavaScript.

## Measured Performance[#](#measured-performance)

**Hardware:** [Xiaomi 17](https://www.mi.com/global/product/xiaomi-17/) with 12 GB LPDDR5X memory and Android 16 /
API 36. Its 3 nm [Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5](https://www.qualcomm.com/smartphones/products/8-series/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5)
(SM8850) has an 8-core Qualcomm Oryon CPU (2 Prime cores up to 4.6 GHz and 6 Performance cores up to 3.62 GHz),
Adreno GPU, and Hexagon NPU.

- **Speed** values are **single-image burst latencies** — the mean of 15 runs after 3 warmup runs on `bus.jpg`, measured with the [Ultralytics Flutter plugin](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolo-flutter-app) `0.6.10` and the standardized `v0.6.6` assets. CPU/GPU order alternated between tasks in one sequential sweep. Native logs confirmed that every CPU row used LiteRT CPU/XNNPACK and every GPU row delegated the complete graph to LiteRT OpenCL (`LITERT_CL`).
- The LiteRT export traces the PyTorch model directly, producing an **NCHW** `.tflite` with a float input — the GPU delegate compiles the whole graph (all seven tasks run on the Adreno GPU here), and `w8a32` needs no calibration data. Consumers should read tensor shapes and signature names instead of assuming the legacy onnx2tf NHWC layout or `Identity` output names; pack RGB data directly as planar CHW or transpose it before inference. Semantic exports return NCHW logits and require a host-side class argmax. The official Android assets are hosted on the [yolo-flutter-app `v0.6.6` release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolo-flutter-app/releases/tag/v0.6.6), with the detailed benchmark record in [the Flutter performance doc](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolo-flutter-app/blob/main/doc/performance.md).
- The matching Snapdragon **Hexagon NPU** and LiteRT CPU/GPU numbers are in the [Qualcomm QNN integration](/integrations/qnn).
- Compare the Apple CPU/accelerator results in the [CoreML integration](/integrations/coreml#measured-performance).

The following device sweeps use the same standardized `v0.6.6` assets.

## Export to LiteRT: Converting Your YOLO Model[#](#export-to-litert-converting-your-yolo-model)

You can improve on-device execution efficiency and broaden deployment options by converting your models to the LiteRT format.

### Installation[#](#installation)

To install the required package, run:

Installation

CLI

```auto
# Install the required package for YOLO
pip install ultralytics
```

For detailed instructions and best practices, check our [Ultralytics Installation guide](/quickstart). If you encounter any difficulties, consult our [Common Issues guide](/guides/yolo-common-issues).

Platform support

LiteRT **export** is currently supported on **Linux x86\_64** and **macOS**. The exported `.tflite` model itself runs on all LiteRT-supported platforms (mobile, embedded, edge, and the browser).

### Usage[#](#usage)

All [Ultralytics YOLO models](/models) support export out of the box. The LiteRT format supports the [Export](/modes/export), [Predict](/modes/predict), and [Validate](/modes/val) modes, so you can export a model, then load it to run inference or validate its accuracy locally.

Export

PythonCLI

```auto
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLO26 model
model = YOLO("yolo26n.pt")

# Export the model to LiteRT format
model.export(format="litert", imgsz=640)  # creates 'yolo26n.tflite'; use imgsz=224 for classification
```

Quantized export

PythonCLI

```auto
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolo26n.pt")

# Dynamic INT8: int8 weights, FP32 activations - no calibration data needed
model.export(format="litert", quantize="w8a32", imgsz=640)  # creates 'yolo26n_w8a32.tflite'

# Static INT8: int8 weights + int8 activations - needs calibration data
model.export(format="litert", quantize=8, data="coco8.yaml", imgsz=640)  # creates 'yolo26n_int8.tflite'

# Static w8a16: int8 weights + int16 activations (higher accuracy) - needs calibration data
model.export(format="litert", quantize="w8a16", data="coco8.yaml", imgsz=640)  # creates 'yolo26n_w8a16.tflite'
```

Predict

PythonCLI

```auto
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the exported LiteRT model
model = YOLO("yolo26n.tflite")

# Run inference
results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")
```

Validate

PythonCLI

```auto
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load the exported LiteRT model
model = YOLO("yolo26n.tflite")

# Validate accuracy on the COCO8 dataset
metrics = model.val(data="coco8.yaml")
```

### Export Arguments[#](#export-arguments)

| Argument | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | `str` | `'litert'` | Target format for the exported model, defining compatibility with various deployment environments. |
| `imgsz` | `int` or `tuple` | `640` | Desired image size for the model input. Can be an integer for square images or a tuple `(height, width)` for specific dimensions. |
| `quantize` | `int` or `str` | `None` | Quantization precision: `8` (static INT8, int8 weights + int8 activations; needs calibration `data`/`fraction`), `'w8a16'` (static, int8 weights + int16 activations; needs calibration `data`/`fraction`), `'w8a32'` (dynamic INT8, int8 weights + FP32 activations; no calibration needed), or `32`/unset (FP32). FP16 is not exported separately (see note below). Replaces the deprecated `half`/`int8` flags. |
| `batch` | `int` | `1` | Specifies export model batch inference size or the max number of images the exported model will process concurrently in `predict` mode. |
| `data` | `str` | `None` | Dataset YAML used for INT8 calibration; classification instead takes a dataset directory or a built-in dataset name. If omitted with `quantize=8` or `'w8a16'`, Ultralytics selects the default calibration dataset for the model task. |
| `fraction` | `float`, `int`, or `list` | `1.0` | Calibration subset as a ratio, image count, or `[train, val, test]` ratios/counts. Two-item lists leave `test` full, while `0` skips it. |
| `device` | `str` | `None` | Specifies the device for exporting. LiteRT export runs on CPU (`device=cpu`). |

FP16 precision

Unlike the legacy `tflite` export, LiteRT does not require a separate FP16 export. An FP32 `.tflite` model runs in **half precision at runtime** when using a GPU delegate (WebGPU, OpenCL, Metal) — this is the official LiteRT approach to FP16 inference.

For more details about the export process, visit the [Ultralytics documentation page on exporting](/modes/export).

## Deploying Exported YOLO LiteRT Models[#](#deploying-exported-yolo-litert-models)

After exporting your Ultralytics YOLO model to LiteRT, you can deploy it across platforms. The quickest way to verify it locally is the `YOLO("yolo26n.tflite")` method shown above. For deployment in other environments, see the following resources:

### Mobile & Embedded[#](#mobile--embedded)

- **[Embedded Linux & Raspberry Pi](/guides/raspberry-pi)**: Run LiteRT models on single-board computers, optionally accelerated with a [Coral Edge TPU](/integrations/edge-tpu).
- **[Microcontrollers](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/microcontrollers/overview)**: Deploy on MCUs with only a few kilobytes of memory — the core runtime fits in roughly 16 KB on an Arm Cortex-M3.

### Browser & Node.js (LiteRT.js)[#](#browser--nodejs-litertjs)

- **[LiteRT.js overview](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/web)**: Run the same `.tflite` model directly in the browser with WebGPU/WASM acceleration, eliminating server-side computation and keeping data on the user's device.

## Summary[#](#summary)

In this guide, we covered how to export Ultralytics YOLO models to the LiteRT format. By consolidating mobile/edge (formerly TFLite) and browser (formerly TF.js) deployment into a single `.tflite` model, LiteRT makes your YOLO models faster, smaller, and portable across virtually every on-device target.

For further details, visit the [LiteRT official documentation](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/overview).

## FAQ[#](#faq)

- ### How do I export a YOLO model to LiteRT format?

  Use the Ultralytics library to export a YOLO model to LiteRT (`.tflite`). First, install the package:

  ```auto
  pip install ultralytics
  ```

  Then export your model:

  ```auto
  from ultralytics import YOLO

  # Load a YOLO26 model
  model = YOLO("yolo26n.pt")

  # Export the model to LiteRT format
  model.export(format="litert", imgsz=640)  # use imgsz=224 for classification
  ```

  For CLI users:

  ```auto
  yolo export model=yolo26n.pt format=litert imgsz=640 # use imgsz=224 for classification
  ```

  For more details, visit the [Ultralytics export guide](/modes/export).
- ### What is the difference between LiteRT, TFLite, and TF.js?

  LiteRT is the new name for **TensorFlow Lite** — same `.tflite` model format, same runtime lineage, rebranded by Google. In Ultralytics, the single `litert` export format now covers both use cases that previously required two separate formats:

  - The old `tflite` format → mobile, embedded, and edge deployment.
  - The old `tfjs` format → browser and Node.js deployment, now handled by [LiteRT.js](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/web) running the same `.tflite` file.

  If you have an existing `.tflite` file, you can load it directly with `YOLO("model.tflite")` and it will run through the LiteRT backend.
- ### Can I run YOLO LiteRT models on a Raspberry Pi?

  Yes. Export your model to LiteRT format, then run it on a Raspberry Pi to improve inference speeds. For further optimization, consider a [Coral Edge TPU](/integrations/edge-tpu). For detailed steps, refer to our [Raspberry Pi deployment guide](/guides/raspberry-pi).
- ### Can I run YOLO models in the browser with LiteRT?

  Yes. [LiteRT.js](https://developers.google.com/edge/litert/web) runs the same exported `.tflite` model directly in a web browser or Node.js application, with WebGPU/WASM acceleration. This replaces the previous TensorFlow.js workflow — there is no separate browser export, just deploy your LiteRT model with the LiteRT.js runtime.
- ### Does LiteRT support FP16 (half-precision) inference?

  Yes — at runtime. An FP32 LiteRT model automatically runs in FP16 when executed on a GPU delegate (WebGPU, OpenCL, or Metal), which is the official LiteRT approach. You therefore don't need a dedicated FP16 export; for further compression, use INT8 quantization with `quantize=8`.
- ### How do I troubleshoot common issues during LiteRT export?

  If you encounter errors while exporting YOLO models to LiteRT, common solutions include:

  - **Check platform**: LiteRT export is supported on Linux x86\_64 and macOS. Verify your environment matches.
  - **Check package compatibility**: Ensure you're using a compatible version of Ultralytics. Refer to our [installation guide](/quickstart).
  - **Quantization issues**: When using INT8 quantization, make sure your dataset path is correctly specified in the `data` parameter.

  For additional troubleshooting tips, visit our [Common Issues guide](/guides/yolo-common-issues).
